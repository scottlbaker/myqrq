
## Summary

qrq is a Morse code training program that is intended to help users improve their ability to copy code at high speed.

This is a modified (Linux-only) version of the original qrq program by Fabian Kurz, DJ1YFK


## Usage

qrq sends random calls from a database.
After each call, it waits for the user to copy the call.
If the call is copied correctly, points are credited.

A callsign can be heard again once by pressing F1, hitting F10 quits.
The previous callsign can be reheard by pressing F7.
Options can be changed in the qrrqrc file or by pressing F5.
