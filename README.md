
## Summary

qrq is an open source Morse telegraphy trainer, similar to the classic DOS
version of Rufz by DL4MM, for Linux, Unix, OS X and Windows.

It is intended for improving the user's ability to copy callsigns at high
speed as needed for example for contesting. 

This is a modified (linux-only) version of the original qrq program.


## Usage

qrq sends random calls from a database.
After each call, it waits for the user to copy the call.
If the call is copied correctly, points are credited.

A callsign can be heard again once by pressing F1, hitting F10 quits.
The previous callsign can be reheard by pressing F7.
Options can be changed in the qrrqrc file or by pressing F5.


## Compile / Install

install with: sudo cp qrq /usr/bin
