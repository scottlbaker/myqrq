
This is a modification of the original program by Fabian Kurz et. al.
It has been simplified to be Linux-only and a few changes/enhancements
were made (e.g. for selecting callsign databases)
It is probably incomplete, but "good enough" for my usage.
Please let me know if you have any changes to improve this code.

QRQ - yet another CW trainer - Version 0.3.1

Project website: http://fkurz.net/ham/qrq.html
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

qrq is an open source Morse telegraphy trainer, similar to the classic DOS version of Rufz by DL4MM

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use it

Using qrq is simple: qrq sends random calls from a database. After each
call, it waits for the user to enter what he heard and compares the entered
callsign with the one sent. If the callsign is copied correctly, the speed is
increased by 10 CpM and full points are credited, if there were mistakes in the
callsign entered, the speed decreases by 10 CpM and (depending on how many
letters were correct) only a fraction of the maximum points are credited.

A callsign can be heard again once by pressing F6, hitting F10 quits the
attempt. The INS key toggles between insert and overwrite mode in the callsign
field. Pressing F5 leads to the settings screen. The _previous_ callsign
can be reheard by pressing F7.

The possible speed ranges from 20 CpM (4 WpM) to infinity, the initial speed
can be set by the user.

There is a simple toplist function in qrq which makes it possible for the user
to keep track of his training success or to compare scores with others.
You can submit your highscores via e-Mail to fabian@fkurz.net and they will
appear on the toplist published at http://fkurz.net/ham/qrqtop.html.
The toplist is not protected by any kind of checksum, it's based on honesty.

As of version 0.0.7, the toplist file also includes a timestamp of the attempt,
which makes it possible to keep track of your training progress. Pressing F7
generates a graph score vs. date (GNUplot required, not on Windows).

Options can be changed in the config file qrqrc or via the options menu (F5).
